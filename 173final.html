<br>
For this you are supposed to be able to click on a country and have a graph overlay over the map.<br>
This will work for all countries with thick white stroke border.<br>
If you click on the graph it will go away again<br><br> 
I structured this so eventually I can make it more dynamic, color the countries based on a value, add dynamic graphs.<br>
<br><br>
There are two graphs, the top one shows the average total debt in usd compares to others that can be picked.<br>
The other compares the country selected against the median and mean of all the countries in the dataset with data (including those that can't be picked).<br>
Argentina, Australia, Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Sweden, Uganda, Ukraine. <br>
