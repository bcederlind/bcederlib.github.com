173 ASSIGNMENT 1

<p>
For this assignment I compared the sleep time, dream time and non dreaming time of a few mammals (which animal sleeps the most).  I used R for this project.  First I loaded the csv file and examined the data.  I decided that I would make a bar chart with 2 bars for total sleep time and time dreaming.  In order to make it more manageable I extracted vectors of the values I wanted to use based on column numbers.  This way I was also able to avoid rows with missing data. I noticed one of the animals had a typo for the name (no space), so I manually fixed this error.  After making 3 separate vectors for the total sleep value, time dreaming and species name I plotted the data. 
I used the colors orange and purple because both colors contrast enough to be able to easily see the different bars, in order to do this I used a matrix for the columns in order to group them together.  Then I filled out all the x and y labels in an easily readable way which would make sense to anyone looking at it.  Afterwards I added a legend in order to label the different columns.  I had some more time so I added another animal and another bar column and played around with the size and margins of the plot until it looked ok and everything fit pretty well.  To finish I resized some of the text.  I also had to shorten some of the animal names in order to get the x labels to fit on the graph.  I sorted the data at the end so differences are clearer between species.
